# titanic_prediction
The Titanic Dataset is a very good dataset for begineers to start a journey in data science and participate in competitions in Kaggle.
The main aim of this kennel or project is to predict the servival of the titanic ship by walking through some analytical techniques, data visualisation, and many others procedures that need to be cafefully followed when analysing dataset. We gonna go through the following step-by-step

- Sumarrize data: by looking at the details on the dataframe performing descriptive statistics and data visualizations
- Prepare the Data: transforming the data in order to make it suitable for algorithms to process and work more efficiently in order to give more accurate and precise results. Here, i'm gonna do data cleaning, feature selection and feature engineering
- Evaluate Algorithms: Check the performance of the various regression/classification algorithms like KNN, SVM, logistic regression, randomforest classification, decision tree, Naive Bayes classifier,Perceptron, SGDClassifier,GaussianNB
- Improve Accuracy: After having the best performing algorithms, their parameters and the Hyperparameters are tuned to give maximum results. Therefore, we gonna perform Algorithm Tuning and Ensembles
